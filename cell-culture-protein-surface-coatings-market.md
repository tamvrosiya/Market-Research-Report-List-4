<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell Culture Protein Surface Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-coating</li><li>Pre-coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cell culture protein surface coatings are used to improve cell attachment and growth in culture dishes. In self-coating, the user applies the protein coating directly to the culture dish before adding cells. In pre-coating, the culture dish is already coated with the protein before it is purchased. Self-coating allows for more control over the coating process, while pre-coating offers convenience and time savings. Both types of coatings can significantly impact cell behavior and overall experimental outcomes in cell culture applications.</p></p>
