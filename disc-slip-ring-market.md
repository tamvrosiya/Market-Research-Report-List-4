<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Slip Ring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Integrated Disc Slip Ring</li><li>Separate Disc Slip Ring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disc slip ring market can be classified into two main types: Integrated disc slip ring and Separate disc slip ring. Integrated disc slip ring refers to a design where the slip ring is fully integrated into a single unit with the rotating equipment, such as a motor or turbine. Separate disc slip ring, on the other hand, involves a standalone slip ring device that is mounted separately from the rotating equipment. Both types serve the purpose of transmitting electrical signals and power across rotating interfaces, but they differ in terms of their physical integration with the equipment.</p></p>
