<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized Solar Water Heater</li><li>Non Pressure Solar Water Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of solar water heaters in the market: pressurized and non-pressure systems. Pressurized solar water heaters use a pump to circulate water through the system, providing consistent hot water even during periods of low sunlight. Non-pressure systems rely on gravity to circulate water, making them simpler and more cost-effective, but less efficient in terms of heat retention. Both types are environmentally friendly and energy-efficient solutions for heating water using solar power.</p></p>
