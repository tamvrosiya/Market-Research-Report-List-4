<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray FPD Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray FPD (Flat Panel Detector) technology is categorized into two main types - Indirect Conversion and Direct Conversion. Indirect Conversion FPDs use a scintillator material to convert X-ray photons into visible light, which is then converted into an electrical signal by photodiodes. Direct Conversion FPDs, on the other hand, directly convert X-ray photons into electrical signals using a semiconductor material. Each type has its own advantages and limitations, with Indirect Conversion FPDs offering lower noise levels and better image quality, while Direct Conversion FPDs provide higher efficiency and faster image acquisition.</p></p>
