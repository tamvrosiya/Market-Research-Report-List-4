<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reactive Waterproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Reactive Waterproof Coating</li><li>Dry Reactive Waterproof Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reactive waterproof coatings are divided into two main types: liquid and dry coatings. Liquid reactive waterproof coatings are applied as a liquid and then react with the surface to form a protective barrier against water. These coatings are easy to apply and are commonly used on surfaces such as concrete, metal, and wood. On the other hand, dry reactive coatings come in a powder or solid form and require mixing with water or other liquids to activate their waterproofing properties. Both types provide effective waterproofing solutions for a variety of surfaces.</p></p>
