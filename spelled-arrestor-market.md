<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spelled Arrestor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-line</li><li>End-of-line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-line spelled arrestors are installed directly in the ductwork of a ventilation system, providing continuous filtration as air passes through. This type of arrestor is designed to capture and trap particles before they can be released into the environment. End-of-line spelled arrestors are typically placed at the end of a ventilation system, capturing any remaining particles before the air is discharged outside. Both types of arrestors serve to improve indoor air quality and reduce the spread of contaminants.</p></p>
