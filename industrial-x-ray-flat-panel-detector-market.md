<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial X-Ray flat panel detectors can be classified into two types - direct conversion and indirect conversion. </p><p>Direct conversion detectors convert X-ray photons directly into electrical signals using a semiconductor material such as cadmium telluride or amorphous selenium. This results in higher image quality and faster imaging speed.</p><p>Indirect conversion detectors, on the other hand, convert X-ray photons into light using a scintillator material such as cesium iodide, which is then converted into electrical signals by a photodiode array. While indirect conversion detectors are less expensive, they may have lower image quality compared to direct conversion detectors.</p></p>
