<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Encryption Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-premises</li><li>Cloud</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Encryption software can be classified into two main types: on-premises and cloud-based. On-premises encryption software is installed and operated on local servers within a company's infrastructure, providing full control over data security. Cloud encryption software, on the other hand, operates on a remote server maintained by a third-party provider, offering scalability and accessibility from anywhere. Both types of encryption software aim to protect sensitive information by converting it into code that can only be accessed with the appropriate decryption key.</p></p>
