<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>External Cardiac Pacemakers are divided into two main types: Single Chamber Pacemakers and Dual Chamber Pacemakers. Single Chamber Pacemakers have one lead that sends electrical impulses to one chamber of the heart, typically the right ventricle. Dual Chamber Pacemakers have two leads, one for the right atrium and one for the right ventricle, allowing for more synchronized pacing of the heart. Both types of pacemakers are used to regulate abnormal heart rhythms and improve overall heart function.</p></p>
