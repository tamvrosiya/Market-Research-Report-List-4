<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autotransfusion Systems (ATS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Autotransfusion Systems</li><li>Discontinuous Autotransfusion Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Autotransfusion Systems (ATS) are medical devices used to collect and reinfuse a patient's own blood during surgeries. Continuous Autotransfusion Systems constantly collect and process blood, providing a continuous supply of autologous blood during surgeries. Discontinuous Autotransfusion Systems collect and store blood intermittently, which can be reinfused in the same surgery or stored for later use. Both types of ATS help minimize the need for allogeneic blood transfusions, reducing the risk of complications and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
