<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zeolites Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Zeolite</li><li>Synthetic Zeolite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zeolites are classified into two main types, natural zeolites and synthetic zeolites. Natural zeolites are naturally occurring minerals formed when volcanic rocks and ash react with alkaline groundwater. They are commonly used in agriculture, water purification, and construction. On the other hand, synthetic zeolites are man-made versions of natural zeolites, created through controlled chemical processes. They are often used in industries such as petrochemicals, agriculture, and detergents for their superior adsorption and ion-exchange properties.</p></p>
