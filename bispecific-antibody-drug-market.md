<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bispecific Antibody Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fragment-Based</li><li>IgG-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bispecific antibody drugs can be classified into two main types: Fragment-Based and IgG-Based. Fragment-Based bispecific antibodies are created by combining two different antigen-binding fragments from separate antibodies. These types of drugs typically have lower molecular weight and can be easier to manufacture. On the other hand, IgG-Based bispecific antibodies are created by modifying full-length IgG antibodies to target two different antigens. These drugs often have higher stability and longer half-life in the body compared to Fragment-Based bispecific antibodies.</p></p>
