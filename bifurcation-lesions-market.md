<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bifurcation Lesions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-Stent</li><li>Two-Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bifurcation lesions in the coronary arteries can be treated with the use of one-stent or two-stent techniques. In the one-stent market, a single stent is used to treat the blockage at the site where a main artery branches into two smaller arteries. On the other hand, in the two-stent market, two stents are employed to treat blockages in both the main artery and its branches simultaneously. Each approach has its own benefits and considerations for treating bifurcation lesions effectively.</p></p>
