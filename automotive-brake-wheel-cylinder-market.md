<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Wheel Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston</li><li>Double Piston</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake wheel cylinder market consists of two main types: single piston and double piston. Single piston wheel cylinders have one piston that applies pressure to the brake shoes when the brake pedal is depressed, while double piston wheel cylinders have two pistons that work together to apply pressure evenly on both sides of the brake shoes. Single piston cylinders are simpler in design and typically used in smaller vehicles, while double piston cylinders are more complex and commonly found in larger vehicles for improved braking performance.</p></p>
