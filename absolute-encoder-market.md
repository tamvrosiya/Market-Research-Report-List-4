<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absolute Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shafted</li><li>Hollow Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absolute encoders come in different types to suit various applications. Shafted encoders have a solid shaft that is directly connected to the encoder, making them suitable for applications where precision is essential. Hollow shaft encoders, on the other hand, have a hollow opening in the center that allows them to be mounted directly onto a motor shaft, saving space and reducing complexity in the system. Both types provide accurate position feedback without the need for a reference point, making them ideal for a wide range of industrial processes.</p></p>
