<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphitic Cathode Block Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bottom Block</li><li>Side Block</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Graphitic cathode blocks are crucial components in the production of aluminum through electrolysis. There are two main types in the market: bottom blocks and side blocks. Bottom blocks are located at the bottom of the electrolytic cell and provide support for the liquid aluminum and the bath material. Side blocks are placed along the sides of the cell to create a barrier between the cathode lining and the molten metal. Both types of cathode blocks play a key role in maintaining the efficiency and stability of the electrolysis process in aluminum production.</p></p>
