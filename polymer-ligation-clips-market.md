<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Ligation Clips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Type</li><li>Non-Absorbable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer ligation clips are used in surgical procedures for clamping blood vessels and tissues. The market for these clips is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable clips are designed to degrade and be absorbed by the body over time, reducing the need for removal. In contrast, non-absorbable clips are made of materials that remain in the body permanently. Surgeons can choose between these two types based on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical procedure being performed.</p></p>
