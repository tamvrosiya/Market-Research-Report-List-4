<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Optic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Sensors</li><li>Extrinsic Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fibre optic sensors can be broadly classified into two main types - Intrinsic Sensors and Extrinsic Sensors. Intrinsic Sensors are built directly into the fibre optic cable and rely on changes in the optical properties of the fibre itself to detect changes in the environment. Extrinsic Sensors, on the other hand, involve using an external probe or coating to detect changes in the environment. Both types of sensors have their own advantages and are used in various industries for measuring parameters such as temperature, pressure, and strain.</p></p>
