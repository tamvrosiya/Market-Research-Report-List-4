<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors utilize two main types of conversion methods: Indirect Conversion and Direct Conversion. In Indirect Conversion detectors, X-rays are first converted into light, which is then converted into an electrical signal. This method generally provides higher image resolution and contrast. In Direct Conversion detectors, X-rays are directly converted into electrical signals using semiconductor materials like amorphous selenium. This method tends to have better sensitivity and efficiency in detecting X-rays. Both types play a crucial role in medical imaging technology.</p></p>
