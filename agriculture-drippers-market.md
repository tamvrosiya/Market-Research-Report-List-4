<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Drippers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Compensating Drippers</li><li>Non-pressure Compensated Drippers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure Compensating Drippers are designed to deliver a consistent flowrate regardless of changes in pressure. This type of dripper ensures uniform irrigation across the entire system, making it ideal for slopes or areas with uneven elevation. On the other hand, Non-pressure Compensated Drippers do not adjust for changes in pressure, resulting in varying flow rates throughout the irrigation system. While they are typically more affordable, non-pressure compensated drippers may not be suitable for areas with fluctuating water pressure.</p></p>
